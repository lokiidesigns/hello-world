# hello-world
First foray into understanding Git and Github. Will be used in all likelihood to store useless facts and information.

So i have updated the ReadME after eventually working out where it was located.....not speled out in the Hello-World process but not overly unintuitive

Testing ot branching and commits now.....seems easy enough.
